## 🛠️ Data Cleaning & Transformation

Before building the dashboard, the dataset underwent several preprocessing steps in Power BI's **Power Query Editor**:

- 🧹 **Removed empty columns** to clean up irrelevant data.
- ✂️ **Used "Split Column"** to extract meaningful numeric values from mixed-format fields (e.g., salaries or ratings).
- 🔢 **Filtered and transformed** numeric fields to calculate averages accurately.
- 🔄 Replaced inconsistent or placeholder values (e.g., "Other", blanks) with meaningful categories or nulls.
